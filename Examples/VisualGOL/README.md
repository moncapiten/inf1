g++ -o newTestOutput.exe new.cpp -I"C:\SDL3-lib\include" -L"C:\SDL3-lib\lib" -lSDL3

the library files are in C:\SDL3, theres all the .h and .c and the lib/*.dll has been set as parth of PATH in environment variables for the account so that it don't need to be in every single folder, it does need to be sent if you plan to share the executables with other ppl
